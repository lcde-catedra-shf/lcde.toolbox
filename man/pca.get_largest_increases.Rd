\title{Get Largest Increases in PCA Data}
\usage{
pca.get_largest_increases(
  this,
  number,
  keys,
  years,
  labels = NULL,
  errors = "warn"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{this}{A PCA object of class 'pca'.}

\item{number}{An integer specifying the number of largest increases to return.}

\item{keys}{A vector of keys (variables) for which the largest increases are to be calculated.}

\item{years}{A numeric vector indicating the years corresponding to the data points.}

\item{labels}{(Optional) A vector of labels for each key, used for annotation. Defaults to empty strings.}

\item{errors}{A character string indicating how to handle errors:
'raise' to stop execution, 'warn' to issue a warning, or 'ignore' to suppress errors.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the largest increases, including keys, labels,
        and the first two principal component coordinates for the specified number of largest increases.
}
\description{
This function calculates the largest increases in principal component scores
between two specified years for given keys (variables). It helps in identifying
which variables have changed the most over time in PCA analysis.
}
\details{
The function performs several checks on the input parameters to ensure they meet
the expected criteria. It calculates the difference in principal component scores
between the minimum and maximum years provided and returns a data frame with the
specified number of largest increases. If there are fewer increases than requested,
it will handle errors based on the specified `errors` parameter.
}
\examples{
# Assuming pca_obj is a valid PCA object
largest_increases <- pca.get_largest_increases(
  this = pca_obj,
  number = 5,
  keys = c("Variable1", "Variable2", "Variable3"),
  years = c(2020, 2021, 2022),
  labels = c("Label1", "Label2", "Label3")
)
